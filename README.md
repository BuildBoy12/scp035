# SCP-035

Adds a passive SCP to the game. A certain amount of items will randomly be selected to be SCP-035 from a configurable list of item types. If a player picks up the item that SCP-035 is disguised as, the player will be killed and a random spectator will be assigned their possessed body. This player will be able to kill their own class, bypassing friendly fire rules. They will also deal corrosive damage when in a set range of another player. Once SCP-035 dies, he will return to disguising into items until his next victim picks him up.
